SyriaTel needs a strong and datadriven approach to proactively tackle customer turnover and increase retention of customers.\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use SyriaTel's customer data to create a model for predicting customer churn. SyriaTel will be able to implement targeted retention strategies and reduce customer attrition by using the model to identify customers who are at high risk of churning. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objectives\n",
    "- Forecasting customer churn to lower client attrition.\n",
    "- Focusing on high-risk consumers for retention efforts.\n",
    "- Increasing customer lifetime value by focusing on significant revenue contributors.\n",
    "- Enhancing client experience to increase satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
    "- Using model insights for customized marketing campaigns to re-engage potential customers.\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "The project will make use of a dataset from SyriaTel's customer relationship management (CRM) system that contains previous customer data. Features like user demographics, account information, call usage trends, and customer service interactions are anticipated to be included in this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Benefits\n",
    "- Better customer experience: By anticipating problems and knowing how customers behave, businesses can build loyalty and improve the overall customer experience.\n",
    "- Data-driven decision making: Strategic customer retention initiatives and resource allocation are guided by insights.\n",
    "- Customized marketing initiatives: Models help with campaign customization for particular clientele groups.\n",
    "- Proactive customer engagement: By addressing customer complaints and preventing churn, early detection of churn risk helps to prevent it.\n",
